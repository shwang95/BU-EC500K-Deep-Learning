    "1. In TensorFlow, extract 32-dimensional features from the **distance layer** of your trained Siamese network, for the MNIST **test set**.\n",
    "2. Reduce the dimensionality of your deep features to 2 using [t-SNE embedding](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/). You may use [this fast implementation](https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne/) with correct attribution. You could alternatively use [sklearn.manifold.TSNE](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html), but please take note that it might be slow.\n",
    "3. Visualize the 2-dimensional embeddings. If your extracted features are good, data points representing a specific digit should appear within a compact cluster. In the example below, each color corresponds to a digit class.\n",
