    "In this example we train an RNN to infer the parameters of a simple dynamical system.\n",

    "1. We define a discretized [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system).\n",
    "At each discrete time $t$, the system observes input $x_t$. The system maintains some \"state\" $h_t$, which will be updated over time.\n",
    "Specifically, the states are updated by the following rule: $h_t = \\max(0, 1-(Wx_t+h_{t-1}))$, where $W$ is a parameter matrix.\n",
    "2. In this example, the input data $\\{x_t\\}$ is randomly generated, and the weight matrix $W$ is also drawn randomly. The system starts from an initial hidden state $h_0$, and runs for $t=1,\\ldots,T$.\n",
    "3. Given the sequence of states $\\{h_1,\\ldots,h_T\\}$, we would like to infer the weights $W$.\n",

    "For this question, we will consider designing an unsupervised probability distribution  over two modalities.  Suppose we have data consisting of images and their associated captions, so that each input data point may be thought of as the pair $(t,v)$, where $t = (t_1, ..., t_n)$ is the text data and $v = (v_1, ..., v_m)$ is the visual data.  For simplicity, we will consider both as vector inputs (so, for instance, we will not be considering any two-dimensional convolutions for the visual data); the main difference between the two inputs is that the text input is discrete-valued, where we assume that each $t_i$ can take on $k$ different values, and each visual input is real-valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following our discussion of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), we will further consider a hidden layer with **binary** hidden units $(h_1, ..., h_d)$, and define a joint probability distribution over an input data point and a hidden layer.  In particular, let us define two matrices $W_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$ and $W_v\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}$; these matrices correspond to weights between text input and hidden units, and weights between visual input and hidden units, respectively.  In addition, we have the bias vectors $a$, $b$, and $c$, associated with the text, visual, and hidden units, respectively.\n",

    "$E(v,t,h) = -t^T W_t h - v^T W_v h - a^T t + (0.5 b^Tb - b^T v + 0.5 v^T v) - c^T h$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our goal is to perform maximum likelihood estimation for the parameters $W_t$, $W_v$, and $c$ (we will assume $a$ and $b$ are fixed and known), given a set of $N$ data points $D = \\{(t^{(1)},v^{(1)}), ..., (t^{(N)},v^{(N)})\\}$.  As is typical in such settings, we assume that the data in $D$ are i.i.d. samples.\n",
